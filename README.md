PokePrefix

This project was developed at the first APNIC IPv6 Hackathon, Kathmandu, Nepal. The aim of this project is to encourage the use of IPv6 networks by introducing a game that follows the model of Pokemon Go. For every IPv6 prefix the user finds, a certain number of points are allotted depending on how remote/rare the location of the prefix is. The user gets to name the prefix if it is a new one. This repository includes a random name generator which provides the user wwith quirky, unusual names. 

The front end is developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. The backend: Python, Flask.
